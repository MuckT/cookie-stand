### Reflections and Comments

#### LAB - 06 Reflections

* This project was the first one we added elements to the DOM from JavaScript. It was a challenge for me, and I found some of the methods covered in the book a bit verbose. The code help we received from Ryan and classmates helped clarify an easier way.

* This was certainly a jump up in what we've learned. I found it challenging to render elements in the DOM, but overall it was a really fun and challenging lab building on things I hadn't done before.

* It took around 6 hours to complete this assignment. I thought it would take less time; however, working with classmates and doing some CSS fixes ate up a bit of my time.

#### LAB - 07 Reflections

* I enjoyed this lab using constructors and prototypes as there was a lot repetition and it resulted in cleaner code. I hadn't used prototypes to my knowledge before so that was something new. I also added some media queries to help with the table formatting on mobile. I look forward to spending more time on some of the stretch goals including using a control curve on the customer flow per hour.

* I also having worked with dynamically generating tables before. The unexpected impact of tables on my grid layout of page was a fun thing to find a solution to.

#### LAB - 08 Reflections

* I refactored the table logic to create the table using a matrix instead of grabbing values from the HTML.

* I took the time to style the table and homepage to be mobile friendly additionally I implemented CSS grid to make the image displays simple and switched the grid layout based on a media query.
